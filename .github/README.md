# Intro

So you wanna learn what is sharding. Congrats, you've ended up in the right place. Learn more about sharing in **general** [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/database-sharding/). And also see the examples implemented here in this repo by watching this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8sk75-6W0ik?si=qICl1DboCdU4V3mB).
